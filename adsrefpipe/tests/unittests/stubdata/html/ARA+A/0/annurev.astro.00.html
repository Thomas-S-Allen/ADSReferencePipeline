This laboratory had been established by the Australian Government in 1939 to develop radar for the military services and a general account of its wartime activities may be found in <a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B9')">MacLeod (1999)</a>. The laboratory was located in the grounds of the University of Sydney and it became customary under wartime regulations for the final year Electrical Engineering Honors students to be assigned to the laboratory as Assistant Research Officers, once their course work had been completed.</p><p>It was thus, in December 1942, that my professional career began as an engineer, well versed in structural design and electrical engineering but with my only knowledge of astronomy, or even twentieth-century physics, derived from reading popular science and science fiction. The possibility of a career in astronomy would have never entered my head. I was placed in the receiver group at the laboratory and over the next few years became expert in the design and general development of receivers and display systems. This is just what was needed later, but a lot had to happen before I became involved in the emerging field of radio astronomy.</p><p>Shortly after the end of World War II, the activities of the laboratory were changing and I was assigned to the development of an X-ray machine using a resonant cavity powered by a magnetron and producing voltages around 1 MV. This was my first exposure to physics that went beyond Maxwell's equations, a practical introduction to relativity, and even some quantum physics. The challenge was fascinating and it eventually led to a major publication (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B10')">Mills 1950</a>). I then spent some time assisting with the development of Australia's first digital computer until, in 1948, Joe Pawsey gave me the choice of continuing this work on the computer or joining his group, which had recently made some remarkable astronomical discoveries. The choice was easy, not only because the mechanics of computation did not really interest me, but because of the opportunity to study some completely new phenomena that were apparently not understood by anyone, and also to be working with Pawsey, whom I had come to know well and respect. By this time the study of radio astronomy was well established in the laboratory with various groups of people involved in its different aspects. I have already given an overall account of the development of radio astronomy in Australia (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B19')">Mills 1988</a>) and here I will limit myself to some of the matters in which I was directly involved, particularly in the evolution of early ideas.</p><p>My initiation began through assisting Chris Christiansen with observations of the solar eclipse of November 1, 1948, at a wavelength of 50 cm. I undertook the local observations while he and Don Yabsley departed to distant locations to provide three independent records of the eclipse, which allowed us to precisely locate the hot spots of solar emission. This led to my first paper in radio astronomy, albeit as junior author (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B5')">Christiansen, Yabsley &amp; Mills 1949</a>).</p><p>Following these observations, I had a long discussion with Pawsey about the technical problems facing the group and what project I could adopt as my own. He had two suggestions, either to begin a program on the discrete sources making use of a 97 MHz swept-lobe interferometer, which he had initiated to study the apparently fast moving bursts of radiation from the Sun (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B8')">Little &amp; Payne-Scott 1951</a>), or else to attempt to detect the H I 21-cm line that had been predicted by van de Hulst. If I had been a trained astronomer and therefore aware of the possible great importance of the H line no doubt this would have been my choice, but I looked on it as merely a technical challenge, whereas I was intrigued by the mystery of the discrete sources and had no hesitation in choosing this option. This did ensure some friction within the group as John Bolton had made discrete sources his own, following his use of the cliff-top interferometer to discover the first such source (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B3')">Bolton &amp; Stanley 1948</a>) and to establish the existence of this class of object by finding several others. However, Pawsey knew that the future lay with the use of horizontal baselines and Bolton was still making effective use of the interferometer that had proved so successful for him previously.</p><p>I began my project by modifying the swept-lobe interferometer for the detection of faint signals, and then, together with fellow engineer Adin Thomas, began a series of observations of Cygnus A, which had been the first and brightest source to be found by Bolton. The primary aim was to determine its position as accurately as possible, and this involved a thorough study of the intricacies of astronomical position measurement as well as the general study of astronomy that I was undertaking at the time.</p><p>Eventually we determined a position with probable errors of some two minutes of arc. A photograph of the general area of the Cygnus source had been sent to Bolton by Rudolph Minkowski and on the photograph, after much trouble, we found a small nebulous object within our positional uncertainties. We were confident that this was the source and that it was a Galactic nebulosity because of its location so close to the Galactic plane. However, before publishing I wrote to Minkowski to seek his interpretation, naturally expecting that he would confirm our identification. He did not; the object was a distant galaxy quite similar to others nearby and was certainly not the source that was most probably a nearby star of peculiar properties. This was all very disappointing but we accepted the judgement of such an eminent astronomer. Consequently I decided against immediate publication and spent a long time investigating the violent fluctuations in intensity of the source and their relation to the ionosphere; the final paper made only a passing reference to the galaxy and rejected the identification (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B25')">Mills &amp; Thomas 1951</a>). Shortly after this paper eventually appeared Graham Smith, who had been carrying out a series of observations on this and other sources at Cambridge, published his final position in <i>Nature</i>. This induced <a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B2')">Baade &amp; Minkowski (1954)</a> to examine the region with the Hale telescope and led to identification with the same galaxy that we had found; they also described the object as two galaxies in collision and this became the standard explanation for most radio galaxies during the next decade. I could not really blame Minkowski for dismissing our result, because three positions of the source had been published previously, all in wild disagreement and in disagreement with ours; the radio measurements of obviously ignorant newcomers were clearly not taken seriously, especially when in conflict with the conventional wisdom. However, the whole episode marked the beginning of my development of a healthy scepticism toward authoritative pronouncements and the confidence to rely on my own judgment, although I did accept without question the colliding galaxy story because it was a very plausible explanation for the extreme abnormality of a whole galaxy.</p><p>Our paper also demonstrated that we were all in unfamiliar territory. In discussing the various corrections necessary to determine the true position of the source, I stated that no correction was needed for aberration, an interesting if elementary mistake that went unnoticed by colleagues who read the paper. It arose because the textbook discussion of aberration was then based on the passage of light down the tube of a telescope, whereas interferometers obviously required a different approach. I thought that relativity would be needed and should have consulted an appropriate textbook, but worked it out for myself employing both inertial frames, thus concluding that there would be no change in the interference fringes with changes of velocity. This was rather like Dingle's famous blunder of some years later, if at a more elementary level. However, it did not matter because in those days the errors of observation were larger than the aberration.</p><p>From the beginning of our observations of Cygnus A it was clear that the sensitivity was inadequate for a general study of the discrete sources and that antennas very much larger than the simple Yagis of the swept-lobe interferometer would be required, preferably located in an area less subject to electrical interference. I found a suitable area some 50 km away and, as soon as our observations ceased, set about constructing a new interferometer. This presented no problems as the Radio Physics Laboratory (now the Division of Radiophysics in CSIRO) had excellent workshop and design facilities stemming from its wartime activities. Apart from larger antennas, the interferometer was similar to the earlier one and operated at nearly the same wavelength, close to 3 m. Also, provision was made for the simultaneous recording of the output of two interferometer spacings from the three antennas disposed along an east-west line; this enabled identification of the central lobe of the interference pattern and, as an unexpected bonus, measurement of some angular sizes.</p><p>Although the new interferometer was designed for accurate positional measurements, I began with a general sky survey, finding 77 sources with only rough positions. This survey immediately generated some surprising and puzzling results (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B11')">Mills 1952</a>). It was then believed that the discrete sources were stars having radio emissions many orders of magnitude greater than normal stars and that they were randomly distributed over the sky, the general radio emission from the Galaxy being the integrated emission from such radio stars, analogous to the optical situation. The identifications with nebulae suggested by Bolton were believed to be either wrong or else the nebulae were not representative of the population of discrete sources; Bolton himself appeared to believe the latter alternative.</p><p>I began as far as possible without assumptions and an operational definition, which stated that "discrete sources are defined in terms of a particular pattern on the pen recorder." The survey then showed that the distribution of such discrete sources was not completely random and the strongest sources were distributed along the plane of the Galaxy, with only the weaker appearing to be randomly distributed over the remainder of the sky. Clearly, this indicated a population of strong emitters distributed thinly through the Galaxy, possibly like the Crab Nebula, but what were the others, radio stars or radio galaxies or both? It was easy to show that the integrated emission from the population of Galactic sources was insufficient to explain the total Galactic radio emission and another origin was required. It seemed more plausible that the intense nonthermal radiation was associated with stars rather than the tenuous interstellar medium, but identifications with nebulae, both Galactic and extragalactic, suggested the latter and the survey had also produced evidence that some of the sources detected had angular sizes in the region of half a degree.</p><p>All identifications were based on positional coincidences, but to decide with certainty whether the randomly distributed sources were galaxies or stars it seemed necessary to measure angular sizes with a resolution of better than a minute of arc. So I added a small portable antenna connected to the interferometer system by a radio link, thus permitting flexibility in orientation and spacings of many kilometers. The principal technical problem of equalizing the propagation time from each interferometer antenna to the mixing point was overcome by the use of adjustable mercury-filled acoustic delay lines borrowed from the computing group where I had been working previously, and where they were used as memory devices.</p><p>Some results were needed quickly because the 1952 General Assembly of L'Union Radio-Scientifique Internationale (URSI) was to be held in Sydney with a strong emphasis on radio astronomy, and it would be nice to have something to say about this contentious issue. Accordingly, I undertook a series of observations on the four strongest sources visible from Sydney (Cygnus A, Taurus A, Virgo A, and Centaurus A) using four east-west spacings chosen from available locations to give definite answers as quickly as possible. The sources were all resolved with indicated sizes consistent with the size of the identified nebulae, although the limited spacings caused me to miss the complexity for Cygnus A and, hence, the double nature of the source. It turned out that the Cambridge and Manchester groups had also been engaged in measuring angular sizes using different techniques and also reported the results at the URSI meeting; they had measured the sources Cygnus A and Cassiopeia A. All results were similar although not identical, and we arranged to publish them simultaneously in <i>Nature</i>, a rare example of collaboration at the time (see <a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B29')">Sullivan 1982</a>). Later I made further observations at three different azimuths (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B12')">Mills 1953</a>) and constructed simple two-dimensional models, which were consistent with the observations but unfortunately gave very misleading information for Centaurus A because of the complexity of the source, the limited number of observations, and the absence of phase information. This was also the first attempt at gray scale presentation of radio brightness distributions, although prepared by darkroom manipulation rather than computer printout.</p><p>Continuing on, from the survey results and what I had gleaned from talking to other workers in the field (whom I had met for the first time at the URSI meeting), I had begun to think seriously of future needs. Simple interferometers were clearly inadequate to deal with the complexity that was showing up. Of course, everyone was aware that Fourier synthesis enabled complex distributions to be reconstructed but the technical problems were daunting. The phase between antennas had to be maintained accurately over long periods and at different locations. More seriously, the only way to perform Fourier transforms in a reasonable time was to use the Radiophysics computer, which was still under development and hardly to be considered as an essential part of an observing program. Perhaps just as important for me was the long time that the actual observations would take; Fourier synthesis had no appeal, and I did not really consider it seriously.</p><p>Early work of Hanbury Brown at Manchester had demonstrated the virtues of a simple parabolic reflector and there were now plans to build the large steerable reflector at Jodrell Bank. First thoughts were also being given for a similar instrument in Australia. The need for such a general purpose instrument was obvious but the cost ruled it out at that time and, like many others in the Laboratory, I began to think of cheaper ways of making an instrument that could directly image the sky with a reasonably high resolution. One thought, quickly dismissed, envisaged an enormous half Luneberg lens sitting on a horizontal plane reflector, but what could be used for the dielectric construction material? A helpful suggestion was that a mixture of beer bottles and sand would be appropriate for an Australian telescope!</p><p>By now it was clear that the spectrum of nonthermal emission was such that at low frequencies the performance of a very large antenna would be dominated by resolution rather than sensitivity. Accordingly I began thinking of constructing partially filled antennas such as rings, squares, and crosses, but all suffered from severe problems with unwanted responses. A solution occurred to me after discussing the imaging problem with Christiansen who was using two grating arrays along the sides of a reservoir to produce maps of the Sun by the first application of earth rotation synthesis. However, fast imaging was really needed because of the variable solar emission, quite apart from the inconvenience of carrying out Fourier transforms when no computer was available. With my thoughts concentrated on linear arrays I soon realized that a solution to both our needs was an antenna in the form of a symmetrical cross, with the outputs of the arms combined through a phase reversing switch as then used in my interferometer systems. Only the signals received in the overlapping area of the fan beams would produce a modulated signal that could be picked out with a phase-sensitive detector to produce a simple pencil beam response or, in the case of grating arrays, an array of pencil beams. This process effectively multiplied the two antenna responses.</p><p>There was opposition to the idea in the Laboratory for some technical reason that I never really understood, and perhaps a political reason, which I could well understand. However, Pawsey supported me and gave approval for the construction of a small experimental model to explore the technique. He also assigned the laboratory's brightest young Technical Officer, Alec Little, to help and this was the beginning of a long and fruitful association. A small "Cross" of a mere 36 m was quickly constructed and confirmed all expectations, even detecting continuum radiation from the Large Magellanic Cloud for the first time (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B21')">Mills &amp; Little 1953</a>). After this successful demonstration, manpower and funds were made available for the construction and operation of a full scale Cross, and I set about establishing the basic design and finding a suitable site. Fortunately there was a disused airstrip not far from my existing interferometer that provided an adequate area of flat ground, which we were able to lease; construction began there in 1953 and this became the Fleurs Radio Observatory.</p><p>During all this activity I received an invitation to spend six months in the United States visiting the California Institute of Technology and the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, which was developing a program in radio astronomy. The invitation came at an awkward time, but to decline was unthinkable and I had no qualms about leaving the supervision of construction in the capable hands of Alec Little. This visit was well worthwhile as the few months spent at Cal Tech marked a turning point in my grasp of astronomy and astrophysics. Discussions with some of the leading astronomers and astrophysicists of the day (particularly the iconoclastic Fritz Zwicky), attendance at colloquia, and even a postgraduate course on stellar structure all helped to fill in some of the numerous gaps in the knowledge I had managed to acquire. I returned home in early 1954 with my mind full of plans for observational programs.</p><p>Physical construction of the Cross was now essentially complete and there only remained its adjustment and the completion of the associated electronics, all of which took but a few months. A full description is given in the radio astronomy issue of the <i>P.I.R.E</i> (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B23')">Mills et al. 1958</a>). Briefly, it operated at a wavelength of 3.5 m and had a beamwidth of 48 arcmin at the zenith; the sensitivity approached 1 Jy under ideal conditions, which was close to the level at which I expected resolution would become a problem. Provision was made for the rapid switching of the north-south array to provide five outputs separated by half a beamwidth for the production of isophotes and for fast surveys, although with reduced sensitivity.</p><p>The next few years saw frenetic activity, exploring and making sense of the radio universe and what it contained. Much of this work is described in three review articles (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B14 B17 B18')">Mills 1959a, 1964, 1984</a>). The last describes in considerable detail our well-known exposure of the errors in the Cambridge 2C catalog of radio sources, and only a few comments are needed here.</p><p>I had just begun a systematic sky survey, together with Bruce Slee, when, as the result of a letter from Fred Hoyle, I first heard of the amazing cosmological claims made by Ryle, which were based on the very large number of faint radio sources included in the Cambridge 2C catalog. It was clear from the survey we had begun that such numbers were impossibly high and it was equally clear that the primary resolution of the Cambridge interferometer was insufficient to separate out so many sources. On obtaining a copy of the catalog we found gross discrepancies with our results in a limited area we had surveyed, but in correspondence Ryle appeared unable or unwilling to understand that he had made such a grievous error and dismissed our results. Accordingly, we published a formal criticism of the catalog and of the conclusion that Ryle had drawn, namely that the radio sources displayed very strong evolutionary effects and therefore the Steady State cosmology could be ruled out (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B24')">Mills &amp; Slee 1957</a>). Although we found a small excess of faint and presumably distant sources, or perhaps more likely a deficiency of nearby strong sources, we showed that instrumental effects tended to produce this result and stated that "there is no clear evidence for any effect of cosmological importance in the source counts, but there is some evidence for significant clustering of the radio sources, which may be indicative of metagalactic structure." Completion of our surveys over the next several years gave no reason to change these opinions, although the evidence for large-scale clustering of the sources was never strong enough to make definite claims. However, evidence for small-scale clusterings, which caused blending of sources in the antenna beam, continued to be found at a significant level.</p><p>Although the Cambridge 2C catalog was largely useless, an important result had been obtained from an analysis of the statistics of the interferometer output (e.g., <a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B27')">Scheuer 1957</a>). This showed that the observed radio emission could not have originated in a population of unresolved discrete radio sources randomly distributed throughout a nonevolving universe. My view expressed at the time was that many of the stronger sources would have been resolved by the interferometer, producing smaller output deflections, and it seemed likely that the distribution of the sources was not random, so that nothing could be said directly about evolution.</p><p>I have never been particularly optimistic about cosmological research because the observational uncertainties and necessary, but often unrecognized, assumptions lead to great difficulties in coming to meaningful conclusions. Nevertheless the subject fascinated me and I did undertake two more activities; an attempt to derive a luminosity function for radio galaxies (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B16')">Mills 1960</a>), and the installation of a remote antenna connected by radio link to the Cross, in the hope that crude angular size data would provide useful additional information (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B6')">Goddard et al. 1960</a>). However, the first program was not very significant without the yet to be discovered quasars and I had left CSIRO before a useful amount of angular size information had been obtained in the second program.</p><p>The most effective use of the Cross turned out to be the study of the closer objects such as nearby galaxies, the Galaxy itself, and some of its components. This period also saw the solution to a problem that had been perplexing me from the beginning, the physical process responsible for nonthermal radio emission. I was aware of suggestions that synchrotron radiation might be the mechanism for the hypothetical radio stars but had somehow missed a less publicized suggestion by Kiepenheuer proposing the same mechanism for the interstellar medium. However, everything fell into place with the confirmation of Shklovskii's conclusion that the optical emission from the Crab Nebula was synchrotron radiation and should be polarized. Work in the Soviet Union on the subject then came to light and there seemed no difficulties in ascribing all the nonthermal radio emission to this process. In particular I found that early Cross observations fitted quite well the model of Galactic emission advanced by <a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B28')">Shklovskii (1952)</a> of a near spherical distribution combined with a disk, although this disk was nonthermal rather than thermal as proposed by Shklovskii. I even went so far as to predict a maximum in the spectrum of Galactic emission at a frequency around 5 MHz as a result of equipartition considerations, and finally laid to rest the radio star hypothesis on finding that there was no detectable radiation from bright globular clusters (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B13')">Mills 1955</a>). Baade later told me that this last result finally convinced him, and all this induced me to take a course in reading scientific Russian.</p><p>Observations continued on emission nebulae, seen both in emission and absorption, and on supernova remnants. A survey of a strip along the Galactic plane and the preparation of isophotes were also completed, thus ending the most obvious programs possible with the Cross.</p><p>By now I was a fully fledged astronomer and attended the 1958 IAU General Assembly in Moscow (my first) and also presented many of the Cross results at the associated Paris Symposium on Radio Astronomy. In one paper I dealt with discrete radio sources and the current problems, and in another I presented new results on Galactic structure (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B15')">Mills 1959b</a>); the latter involved analyses to determine the distribution of high latitude radiation and disk radiation. When observed with the resolution of the Cross, the high latitude radiation was very complex and could not be modelled directly, but there was clear evidence for an irregular, near spherical, distribution and I estimated its gross parameters as well as I could, but with little confidence in the details. For the disk component, however, things were much clearer and, after subtracting discrete sources and background radiation, the longitude distribution displayed a series of marked "steps," some of which corresponded with the tangential directions of known spiral arms, indicating an association. Moreover, all the eight steps found corresponded with all the tangential directions of a two-arm equiangular spiral with an arm inclination of 6.<sup>o</sup>8, suggesting that it represented the basic spiral form of the Galaxy. Needless to say this stirred the H line fraternity and there was much debate.</p><p>I returned from my first IAU meetings and my first visit to Europe well pleased with the reception of our work and with making contact with so many astronomers, but the next two years were to present a multitude of problems and difficult decisions. The very basic questions of a decade earlier had now been answered and further development would clearly involve great expense. In-house funding had so far served us well but the much larger and more expensive instruments required for further advances meant that it would no longer suffice. External funding had already been obtained for the 64-m steerable reflector that was under construction at Parkes (see <a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef('f1')"><b>Figure 1</b></a>) and would meet requirements for high frequency and spectral studies, but which had limitations at the lower frequencies. I believed that, for the study of radio sources and nonthermal emission generally, a large Cross would far outperform the Parkes radio telescope and could be constructed at a reasonable cost, leaving the Parkes instrument free to be used for programs that were more appropriate. However, there seemed little prospect of funding for a Cross, particularly as the other branch of radio astronomy, solar astronomy, had an imposing and expensive program to be funded.</p><a name="f1"></a><a name="f1"><!-- FIG --></a><div class="figureThumbnail"><table summary=""><tr><td class="image"><a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef('f1')"><img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/production/astro/2006/44/1/annurev.astro.44.051905.092522/images/small/aa440001.f1.gif" align="bottom" border="1"></img><br /><strong>View larger version</strong> (55K)<br /></a></td><td class="caption"><p><span class="captionLabel"><b>Figure 1</b>&nbsp;</span> The first working party at Parkes&#8212;fixing the location of the radio telescope.

Pawsey was planning to leave CSIRO before his sudden illness and death in 1962. Jack Piddington transferred to another CSIRO division and Christiansen took up the Chair of Electrical Engineering at Sydney University. My own solution to funding problems came with an offer made by Harry Messel, the new Professor of Physics at Sydney University to undertake the funding for a Cross of an appropriate size. Messel was revitalizing a very run down department and had demonstrated an extraordinary ability to raise money for various scientific projects, including support for the stellar intensity interferometer of Hanbury Brown who would shortly be joining the School of Physics. I accepted Messel's offer with relief, but also with some trepidation because I would no longer have access to the excellent design and workshop facilities of Radiophysics. Indeed, there was opposition from Bowen who could not tolerate what he saw as a rival establishment setting up shop next door.</p><p>In June 1960, I took up the position of Reader in Physics at Sydney University, but for the next few years became an engineer again and, after working out a basic design for the "One Mile Cross" and receiving major funding from the NSF (I believe their first and largest foreign grant), I found myself manager of a big engineering project. It was not an enjoyable job but there was no one else to do it and I was much helped by my engineering contacts, stretching back in some cases to student days. Also, the new Professor of Electrical Engineering, Chris Christiansen, took responsibility for development and construction of the receiving system, which, unlike the first Cross, was based on recently developed solid state technology, now essential because of the complexity of the system. I was also joined by two Radiophysics colleagues, first Arthur Watkinson and later Alec Little, and an international flavor was given by the appointments of Bruce McAdam and Tony Turtle from Cambridge and Michael Large from Manchester.</p><p>A location for the Cross had caused some problems as no suitable area could be found close enough to the University to permit daily visits for observations and maintenance; a remote self-contained observatory was necessary. Here my contacts with Radiophysics colleagues proved helpful. A thorough search had been made for possible locations for the 64-m radio telescope and I was given access to the files, which immediately turned up an ideal site some 200 km from Sydney but not far from the Australian National University in Canberra and the associated Mt. Stromlo Observatory. For us this location was the next best thing to a location near Sydney, so Messel set about acquiring the site, with success. The Molonglo River, which flows through Canberra, is nearby and hence it was named the Molonglo Radio Observatory. Construction began there in late 1962; observations with the east-west arm commenced in 1965 and with the full Cross in 1967.</p><p>The Cross is described in the radio astronomy issue of the Proc. I.R.E. (Australia) by <a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B20')">Mills et al. (1963)</a>. The operating frequency was 408 MHz and the beamwidth just under 3 arcmin at the zenith; multi-beaming was provided as a matter of course. An additional lower frequency, described in the reference, was restricted to the east-west arm because it was realized that the process of installing this frequency for the full Cross would have hampered the initial observing programs, and it was probably unnecessary anyway because of developments at Radiophysics.</p><p>A general account of the first twenty-five years of operation at Molonglo has been presented by several authors in an issue of the <a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B1')"><i>Australian Journal of Physics</i> (1991)</a>, and here I will only present some of the background, with references limited to personal highlights.</p><p>Besides having a new radio telescope, my change of employer signaled a great change in activities. With this appointment went all the usual pursuits of university life: lecturing, supervision of research students, and general university responsibilities, as well as much less time for personal research. A new department in the School of Physics was created in 1965, the Astrophysics Department, with me as Professor and Head; this complemented the existing Astronomy Department under Hanbury Brown and formalized the arrangements under which I had been working.</p><p>During the next decade things proceeded much as planned. By now the mysteries of the radio sources had been largely solved but many questions remained and here the Cross was very effective with accurate position measurements leading to optical identifications, and for plotting low level brightness distributions. Also it was outstanding for rapid surveys of the southern sky, eventually producing the Molonglo Reference Catalogue (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B7')">Large et al. 1981</a>) and detailed surveys of many regions such as the southern Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The discovery of pulsars provided another avenue of research, and the Cross proved to be an excellent search instrument, discovering more than half of the known pulsars by the end of its life and also providing the first association of a pulsar with a supernova remnant.</p><p>I was satisfied with the performance of the Cross and the use that had been made of it but, after nearly 10 years operation, the raw observational data for the whole southern sky had been recorded for posterity on magnetic tape (and indeed work has recently begun on these archival data, now available on CD). It was clear that a higher frequency and better resolution would be needed to break new ground. This situation had been anticipated and provision had been made in the original specifications for a structural accuracy sufficient to permit operation at 1420 MHz. There were originally plans for conversion of the Cross to this frequency, but the development of the Fleurs Synthesis Telescope, also operating at 1420 MHz with sensitivity comparable to that of the projected Cross, led me to reconsider. Two radio telescopes in the one university operating at the same frequency and with similar sensitivity, even if vastly different speeds, hardly seemed an efficient arrangement.</p><p>Future needs appeared to be largely directed toward the mapping of particular objects or regions of the sky with the highest possible sensitivity and resolution. Perhaps now was the time to consider synthesis, using the tiltable east-west arm alone and a phased feed for this arm to produce the equivalent of an alt-alt mounting. Earth rotation synthesis could then produce fully sampled images of sufficiently southern regions in a single twelve-hour observation and useful images of more northerly regions for which observation times were less. The phased feed system using the cheap circularly polarized antennas that I had devised for the planned 1420 MHz Cross (my last piece of real engineering) was ideal for this purpose. Fortunately I immediately saw the best way to carry out synthesis and was not tempted to spend time on other possibilities. Again the multiplication of the outputs of two long antennas was the required solution, although this time the antennas were collinear, the east and west arms of the Cross (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B22')">Mills, Little &amp; Joss 1976</a>).</p><p>By now, plans for 1420 MHz operation had been abandoned, primarily because the cost would have been much more than could be provided by the Australian Research Grants Committee, our source of operating funds. External funding would be needed but we would be competing with CSIRO, which had a much more sophisticated synthesis telescope on the drawing board (eventually the Australia Telescope). The result of such competition could be easily foreseen, so a more modest plan was adopted using a lower frequency for which the existing reflector mesh was adequate and which corresponded with one of the resonant frequencies of the existing waveguide feed structures, which could be retained. The only mechanical changes involved were the provision of the circularly polarized antennas and their driving mechanism, which reduced the cost of conversion to manageable proportions. Several frequencies were physically possible and the final choice of 843 MHz was made after discussions with those in control of frequency allocations; it was deemed to be the least likely to suffer interference in the future.</p><p>With funding assured, the Cross was closed down in 1978 and conversion to the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope or the MOST began; the first synthesis maps were obtained in 1981. Our celebrations were marred, however, by the death of Alec Little who suffered a heart attack while working at the observatory. Alec, the Director of the Observatory, had contributed mightily to the success of MOST, first by carrying out the development of the phased feed system and then by supervising the actual conversion. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of all aspects of the observatory and was sorely missed. I personally lost an old and valued colleague who, for some thirty years, had been deeply involved in instrumental developments with me. It is sad that he did not have the opportunity to see the full results of his work.</p><p>My own departure from the scene was also approaching, owing to the then mandatory retiring age of sixty-five and the University policy of quickly dispensing with emeritus professors. However, I did manage to see through one more large observational program, a study of the supernova remnants in the Magellanic Clouds and a comparison with the conventional wisdom derived from Galactic remnants. There were some anomalies (<a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B26')">Mills et al. 1984</a>).</p><p>So ended my life as an active astronomer: it had been an absorbing search for what the radio spectrum can tell us of the constituents of the Universe and I learned to be grateful for my engineering background, which provided the know-how for development of the necessary instrumentation. It was certainly a privilege to be involved in some of the immense advances that occurred during the early times, and for this I have always acknowledged a debt of gratitude to Joe Pawsey who started me off and provided support and encouragement.</p><p>After retirement and with time to contemplate fundamental issues, my interests gradually changed from the very large to the very small, and I will conclude with an account of some of this postretirement meditation. Since the days when the Dingle fiasco focused attention on the basis of relativity, I had known that an absolute framework is not actually excluded, just unnecessary and inconvenient (e.g., <a class="ref" href="javascript:popRef2('B4')">Builder 1958</a>), and I began to speculate that perhaps the quantum world, which is not directly observable, is an absolute world with peculiar and possibly inconceivable properties that produce the observable world we know. The current successful model of the quantum world is necessarily relativistic as it is based on familiar things, and that is the way the familiar world works; just as mankind has created gods in his own image, so he has created a quantum world in the image of the world he knows. With these thoughts in mind I contemplated ways of testing my speculations and thought I had found a logical flaw in the relativistic viewpoint, but this was due to a simple mistake that was pointed out to me in time to save further embarrassment. Then I realized that instead I had stumbled on a new and very simple way of removing the paradox from the clock paradox. Besides being interesting, this approach could well have a role in the presentation of relativity and, as a coda, I give a brief description illustrating the basic idea.</p><p>The clock paradox is now known as the twin paradox, although the actual paradox has everything to do with clocks and nothing to do with twins. I will adopt the usual scenario involving twins in which one remains in an inertial frame and the other takes off, traveling with constant velocity for a long time then returning at the same speed, eventually coming to rest beside his twin. However, to ensure that each twin knows the time recorded by the other they will now be provided with identical clocks, transmitters for the time signals and receivers to record the signals transmitted by the other twin. It will be assumed that no time signals are lost in the exchange and that the time spent traveling at constant velocity is vastly greater than the time spent accelerating so that time signals sent and received during periods of acceleration may be ignored.</p><p>Two postulates are needed, both based on the postulates of relativity, but weaker as they do not directly involve the velocity of light.</p><table class="listgroup" border="0" width="95%" list-type="order"><tr class="li1"><td valign="top">1.&nbsp;</td><td colspan="5" class="last"><p>Each twin finds the same ratio between the rates of time signals received and transmitted.</p></td></tr><tr class="li1 last"><td valign="top">2.&nbsp;</td><td colspan="5" class="last"><p>Signals are received in the same order they are transmitted, without overlap.</p></td></tr></table><p>The second is now well established (e.g., binary pulsars) and therefore need no longer be a postulate, but I am not aware if there is similar direct evidence for the first.</p><p>To proceed, let the ratio of the rate of received to transmitted signals between the twins be written as <i>r</i>/<i>t = s</i> when separating and <i>r</i>/<i>t = a</i> when approaching and take the total numbers of time signals transmitted and received by the stay-at-home (twin #1) as <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> and the corresponding numbers for the traveler (twin #2) as <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Twin #2 transmits an equal number of signals, <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>/2, when separating and approaching because equal distances are covered with equal speed.

The so-called paradox arises because the usual verbal description is incomplete.</p><p>This approach has made no use of velocities and so yields no measure of the actual time difference, for which we need the crucial postulate that the velocity of light is the same in all inertial frames and the postulate that accompanies it, the apparent isotropy of space in all inertial frames. The ratios <i>s</i> and <i>a</i> are the Doppler shifts for propagation of light between the twins and will require the same velocity of light, <i>c</i>, for each twin. As the elapsed times for the twins are different, an extra factor needs to be introduced that must also be the same for both twins and independent of the direction of motion; let us call it &#x03B4;. Taking the velocity of twin #2 as <i>v</i>, the Doppler shifts may then be written as <i>s</i> = &#x03B4;/(1 + <i>v</i>/<i>c</i>) and <i>a</i> = &#x03B4;/(1 &#8722; <i>v</i>/<i>c</i>), and because <i>s</i> <img src="/entityImage/22C5.gif" alt="" border="0" align="BOTTOM" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></img> <i>a</i> = 1, then <img src="/na101/home/literatum/publisher/ar/journals/production/astro/2006/44/1/annurev.astro.44.051905.092522/images/medium/eq-092522-004.gif" align="bottom" border="0"></img>.
